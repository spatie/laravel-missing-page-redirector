When transitioning from a old site to a new one your URLs may change. If your old site was popular you probably want to retain your SEO worth. One way of doing this is by providing [permanent redirects from your old URLs to your new URLs](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93633?hl=en). This package makes that process very easy.

When installed you only need to [add your redirects to the config file](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-missing-page-redirector#usage). Want to use the database as your source of redirects? [No problem](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-missing-page-redirector#creating-your-own-redirector)!

Spatie is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment you are required to send us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.

The best postcards will get published on the open source page on our website.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-missing-page-redirector
```

The package will automatically register itself.

Next you must register the `Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\RedirectsMissingPages`-middleware:

```php
//app/Http/Kernel.php

protected $middleware = [
       ...
       \Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\RedirectsMissingPages::class,
    ],
```

Finally you must publish the config file:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\MissingPageRedirectorServiceProvider"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /**
     * This is the class responsible for providing the URLs which must be redirected.
     * The only requirement for the redirector is that it needs to implement the
     * `Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\Redirector\Redirector`-interface
     */
    'redirector' => \Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\Redirector\ConfigurationRedirector::class,

    /**
     * When using the `ConfigurationRedirector` you can specify the redirects in this array.
     * You can use Laravel's route parameters here.
     */
    'redirects' => [
//        '/non-existing-page' => '/existing-page',
//        '/old-blog/{url}' => '/new-blog/{url}',
    ],
];
```

## Usage

Creating a redirect is easy. You just have to add an entry to the `redirects` key in the config file.

```php
'redirects' => [
   '/non-existing-page' => '/existing-page',
],
```

You may use route parameters like you're used to when using Laravel's routes:

```php
    'redirects' => [
       '/old-blog/{url}' => '/new-blog/{url}',
    ],
```

Optional parameters are also... an option:

```php
    'redirects' => [
       '/old-blog/{url?}' => '/new-blog/{url}',
    ],
```

It is also possible to optionally specify which http response code is used when performing the redirect. By default the ```301 Moved Permanently``` response code is set. You may override this using the following syntax:   

```php
    'redirects' => [
       'old-page' => ['/new-page', 302],
    ],
```

## Creating your own redirector

By default this package will use the `Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\Redirector\ConfigurationRedirector` which will get its redirects from the config file. If you want to use another source for your redirects (for example a database) you can create your own redirector.

A valid redirector is any class that implements the `Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\Redirector\Redirector`-interface. That interface looks like this:

```php
namespace Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\Redirector;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

interface Redirector
{
    public function getRedirectsFor(Request $request): array;
}

```

The `getRedirectsFor` method should return an array in which the keys are the old URLs and the values the new URLs.
